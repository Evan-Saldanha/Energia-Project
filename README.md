# Energia-Project

Energia is part of the Viridian Group which is the leading independent energy company in the all-Ireland market. Energia supplies electricity to businesses throughout Ireland and to homes in the ROI.

Energia Supply buys electricity from the All-Island market and sell it on to the relevant homes/businesses. This electricity is bought across 5 markets with differing prices.

To optimise the business, Energia tried to buy the electricity in the cheapest market possible through a combination of price forecasting and market trend analysis.

Energy prices are impacted by multiple factors including demand, wind, fuel prices, forecast error and generator costs.

Problem Questions:
1) Assume Energia have 100MW of electricity to buy in each half hour of the day. How can Energia optimise the purchases in ISEM? What factors drive this decision? 
2) Can Energia increase profitability by speculating across the markets by trading more actively?
